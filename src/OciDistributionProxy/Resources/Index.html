    <h1>OCI Distribution Proxy</h1>
    <p>
        This point of this tool is to allow you to easily and cheaply define you own custom domain name for your OCI
        images.
        (These are also known a Docker images).
        By doing so, where your OCI images physically live is no longer tied to name of your image.
        This allows you to move the location where your image is hosted without breaking everyone who uses your image.
    </p>
    <p>
        A longer term goal of this project is enable you to easily mirror your container registry to different clouds.
        This will give consumers of your images a faster download experience while also saving you money on cloud egress
        charges.
